Originally developed by @seaweedchan, this fork adds compability with various forks and more custom options.\r\n\r\n\r\n##[Install](../../raw/master/builds/OneeChan.user.js)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Install instructions\r\n\r\n- Firefox: Requires the Greasemonkey addon.\r\n\r\n- Chrome: Requires the Tampermonkey extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Compatibility with 4chan X forks and others:\r\n(Updated 2014-06-10)\r\n\r\n- [ccd0](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) /// `Compatible` (Recommended)\r\n- [MayhemYDG](https://github.com/MayhemYDG/4chan-x) /// `Compatible`\r\n- [ihavenoface](https://github.com/ihavenoface/4chan-x) /// `Compatible`\r\n- [loadletter](https://github.com/loadletter/4chan-x) /// `Compatible`\r\n- [inline](https://boards.4chan.org/) /// No\r\n\r\nMake sure you select your fork version in `Compatibility`.
