If you use another 4chan X version, please make sure you select your fork version under `Compatibility` in OneeChan options. Enabling Quick Reply and Persistent QR in 4chan X is recommended for maximum compatibility. \r\n\r\nI can't promise everything will work with every fork.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Troubleshooting\r\n\r\n- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and OneeChan settings and restarting your browser\r\n\r\n- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, OneeChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality\r\n\r\n- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/issues) page\r\n\r\n- Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/wiki) for instructions\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Development & Contribution\r\n\r\n[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/Nebukazar/OneeChan/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/Nebukazar/OneeChan#info=devDependencies)\r\n\r\n- [Source Code](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan)\r\n- [Reporting Bugs and Contributing](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### See also:\r\n\r\n- [Windows 7 Ricing Reference](http://nanami-tan.info/)\r\n- [Ruri Gokou Homepage](https://github.com/gokoururi/homepage)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
