OneeChan
====

Maximum rice for Seaweedchan's [4chan X](https://github.com/seaweedchan/4chan-x) and its forks. These are a bunch of dirty fixes but it "just werks", thank you for your understanding.

#### Troubleshooting

- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and OneeChan settings and restarting your browser

- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, OneeChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality

- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/issues) page


#### Known Issues

- OneeChan's settings icon sometimes doesn't render (especially bad on Chrome)
- **Fix:** Load a new tab, refresh the page or navigate to another thread until it shows up
