#### Troubleshooting

- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and OneeChan settings and restarting your browser

- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, OneeChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality

- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/issues) page


#### Known Issues

- OneeChan's settings icon sometimes doesn't render on Chrome (this is related to [popstate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/popstate))
- **Fix:** Open a different thread or navigate to another board until it shows up
