OneeChan
====

Maximum rice for 4chan X. Originally developed by [seaweedchan](https://github.com/seaweedchan), this fork adds compability with various forks and more custom options.


##[Install](https://nebukazar.github.io/OneeChan/builds/OneeChan.user.js)


#### Install instructions

- Firefox: Requires the Greasemonkey addon.

#### Compatibility with 4chan X forks and others:
(Updated 2014-06-10)

- [ccd0](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x) /// `Compatible` (Recommended)
- [MayhemYDG](https://github.com/MayhemYDG/4chan-x) /// `Compatible`
- [ihavenoface](https://github.com/ihavenoface/4chan-x) /// `Compatible`
- [loadletter](https://github.com/loadletter/4chan-x) /// `Compatible`
- [inline](https://boards.4chan.org/) /// No

Make sure you select your fork version in `Compatibility`. Enabling Quick Reply and Persistent QR is recommended for maximum compatibility. I can't promise everything will work with every fork.


#### Troubleshooting

- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and OneeChan settings and restarting your browser

- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, OneeChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality

- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/issues) page


#### Known Issues

- OneeChan's settings icon sometimes doesn't render on Chrome (this is related to [popstate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/popstate))
- **Fix:** Opening a thread with 300+ replies will force it to render.
