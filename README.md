OneeChan
====

Maximum rice for Seaweedchan's [4chan X](https://github.com/seaweedchan/4chan-x). These are a bunch of dirty fixes but it "just werks", thank you for your understanding.

#### Troubleshooting

- If you have any problems, try first resetting your 4chan X and OneeChan settings and restarting your browser

- Check if it's not a 4chan X issue first, OneeChan mostly deals with stylesheets not site functionality

- Something doesn't work let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/Nebukazar/OneeChan/issues) page


#### Known Issues

- Show Ads doesn't show any ads (?)

Chromium:

- Banner opacity breaks the banner reflection

- OneeChan's header link/icon sometimes doesn't get drawn when viewing the catalog

Firefox:

- Nothing yet
