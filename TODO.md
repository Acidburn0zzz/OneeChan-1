- Wiki files
- Notify the user after OneeChan updates, like 4chan X
- Batch export/import of mascots as JSON
- Option to select between different icon sets for Thread Watcher Icon/Backlink Icons
- User can set a custom width for the sidebar (will require a lot of rewrite, and headaches with the different forks support) 
- Show watched threads on (eye) icon hover for both top and bottom header
- Allow user upload by converting mascots into base 64 on the fly
- Custom scrollbars (will require Firefox fixing their stuff first, don't like the JS solution)
